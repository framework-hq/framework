# Why FrameWork?

## The Problem

Building internal tools is tedious. You need the same things every time:

- Authentication
- Database setup
- UI components
- API integrations
- Responsive design

Most teams either:
1. **Build from scratch** — weeks of work for basic functionality
2. **Use low-code platforms** — vendor lock-in, limited customization, recurring fees

## The Solution

FrameWork gives you production-ready templates that are:

- **Free & Open Source** — MIT licensed, no strings attached
- **Self-hosted** — your data stays on your servers
- **Customizable** — it's just React + TypeScript, modify anything
- **Pre-integrated** — common services already wired up

## Who It's For

- **SMBs** building internal tools (CRM, invoicing, booking systems)
- **Agencies** delivering client projects faster
- **Developers** who want a head start without sacrificing control

## Tech Stack

Every template uses:

- **React 18** — modern component architecture
- **TypeScript** — type safety out of the box
- **Vite** — fast dev server and builds
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **Lucide Icons** — beautiful, consistent icons

## Integrations

Templates come pre-wired with popular services:

| Service | Used In | What It Does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) | Landing Page | Email capture & newsletters |
| [Supabase](https://supabase.com) | CRM | Database & authentication |
| [Twilio](https://twilio.com) | Booking | SMS notifications |
| [Stripe](https://stripe.com) | Invoicing | Payment processing |

All integrations include **demo mode** so you can test locally without signing up for anything.
