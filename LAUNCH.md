**Title:** Show HN: FrameWork – Open-source templates for internal tools (CRM, invoicing, booking)

**Text:**
Hey HN,

I built FrameWork because I was tired of paying $50/user/month for internal tools I only half-used.

It's a collection of production-ready templates:
- CRM (Supabase)
- Invoicing (Stripe)
- Booking system (Twilio)
- Dashboard (Recharts)
- Landing page (SendGrid)

All free, MIT licensed, self-hosted. React + TypeScript + Tailwind.

```bash
npx create-framework-app my-app
```

Every template has a "demo mode" that works without external services, so you can try it locally in 2 minutes.

Docs: https://framework-hq.github.io/framework/

Would love feedback on what templates you'd want next.

**First Comment:**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built FrameWork because every time I needed an internal tool, I faced the same choice: pay $50/user/month for a SaaS, or spend weeks building from scratch.

FrameWork is the middle ground - production-ready code you can deploy in minutes and customize forever.

Would love to hear what templates you'd want next!
